# Project 1: PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF SUMO WRESTLING BOUTS
* The goal of this research was to create a model that could predict the outcome of sumo wrestling matches.
* An overview of the many machine learning models or strategies utilised to make this prediction.
* Sumo wrestlersâ€™ wins and losses have been analysed and machine learning models were trained using historical data from 2010 to 2023.
* Four machine learning techniques are employed in this paper: logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, Decision Tree and Random Forest.
* According to the results, the Logistic Regression train accuracy was 59.52%, while the test accuracy was 58.65%; the Decision Tree train accuracy was 55.08%, with a test accuracy of 53.69%; the k-nearest neighbors train accuracy was 65.41%, with the test accuracy 55.75% and the Random Forest Train accuracy was 57.76%, with a test accuracy of 56.45%.
