This portfolio of mine contents all my project works that I have done throughout my masters journey including university projects.


# [Project 1: PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF SUMO WRESTLING BOUTS: Machine Learning](https://github.com/saumyapanigrahi/sumo_wrestling_bouts_prediction)
* The goal of this research was to create a model that could predict the outcome of sumo wrestling matches.
* An overview of the many machine learning models or strategies utilised to make this prediction.
* Sumo wrestlersâ€™ wins and losses have been analysed and machine learning models were trained using historical data from 2010 to 2023.
* Four machine learning techniques are employed in this paper: logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, Decision Tree and Random Forest.
* According to the results, the Logistic Regression train accuracy was 59.52%, while the test accuracy was 58.65%; the Decision Tree train accuracy was 55.08%, with a test accuracy of 53.69%; the k-nearest neighbors train accuracy was 65.41%, with the test accuracy 55.75% and the Random Forest Train accuracy was 57.76%, with a test accuracy of 56.45%.

# [Project 2: LOAN PREDICTION PRACTICE PROBLEM: Machine Learning](https://github.com/saumyapanigrahi/Loan_Prediction_Practice_Problem)
* This project is on Loan Prediction Practice Problem.
* It is based on binary classification solved using Python.
* Introduction to the problem
* Exploratory Data Analysys (EDA) and Pre-processing
* Model building and feature engineering


# [Project 3: RESTAURANT (FOOD HUNTER) DATA ANALYSIS: SQL](https://github.com/saumyapanigrahi/Food_Hunter_Data_Analysis_SQL_Project_1)
* The goal of this project is to analyse the restaurant data and understanding the sales of the restaurant
